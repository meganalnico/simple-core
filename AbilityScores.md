Ability Scores
==============

Each character has six ability scores that represent his character's
most basic attributes. They are his raw talent and prowess. While a
character rarely rolls an ability check (using just an ability score),
these scores, and the modifiers they create, affect nearly every aspect
of a character's skills and abilities. Each ability score generally
ranges from 3 to 18, although racial bonuses and penalties can alter
this; an average ability score is 10.

Assigning Ability Scores
-------------------------

There are a number of different methods used to generate [ability
score](#ability-scores)s. Each of these methods gives a different level
of flexibility and randomness to character generation.

Racial modifiers (adjustments made to your [ability
score](#ability-scores)s due to your character's race—see
[Races](races.html)) are applied after the scores are generated.

**Standard:** Roll 4d6, discard the lowest die result, and add the three
remaining results together. Record this total and repeat the process
until six numbers are generated. Assign these totals to your [ability
score](#ability-scores)s as you see fit. This method is less random than
Classic and tends to create characters with above-average [ability
score](#ability-scores)s.

**Classic:** Roll 3d6 and add the dice together. Record this total and
repeat the process until you generate six numbers. Assign these results
to your [ability score](#ability-scores)s as you see fit. This method is
quite random, and some characters will have clearly superior abilities.
This randomness can be taken one step further, with the totals applied
to specific [ability score](#ability-scores)s in the order they are
rolled. Characters generated using this method are difficult to fit to
predetermined concepts, as their scores might not support given classes
or personalities, and instead are best designed around their [ability
score](#ability-scores)s.

**Heroic:** Roll 2d6 and add 6 to the sum of the dice. Record this total
and repeat the process until six numbers are generated. Assign these
totals to your [ability score](#ability-scores)s as you see fit. This is
less random than the Standard method and generates characters with
mostly above-average scores.

**Dice Pool:** Each character has a pool of 24d6 to assign to his
statistics. Before the dice are rolled, the player selects the number of
dice to roll for each score, with a minimum of 3d6 for each ability.
Once the dice have been assigned, the player rolls each group and totals
the result of the three highest dice. For more high-powered games, the
GM should increase the total number of dice to 28. This method generates
characters of a similar power to the Standard method.

  : Table: Ability Score Points

\
**Purchase:** Each character receives a number of points to spend on
increasing his basic attributes. In this method, all attributes start at
a base of 10. A character can increase an individual score by spending
some of his points. Likewise, he can gain more points to spend on other
scores by decreasing one or more of his [ability
score](#ability-scores)s. No score can be reduced below 7 or raised
above 18 using this method. [See Table: Ability Score
Costs](#table-1-1-ability-score-costs) for the costs of each score.
After all the points are spent, apply any racial modifiers the character
might have.

The number of points you have to spend using the purchase method depends
on the type of campaign you are playing. The standard value for a
character is 15 points. Average nonplayer characters (NPCs) are
typically built using as few as 3 points. [See Table: Ability Score
Points](#table-1-2-ability-score-points) for a number of possible point
values depending on the style of campaign. The purchase method
emphasizes player choice and creates equally balanced characters. This
system is typically used for organized play events, such as the
Pathfinder Society (visit
**[paizo.com/pathfinderSociety](/pathfinderSociety)** for more details
on this exciting campaign).

### Determine Bonuses

Each ability, after changes made because of race, has a modifier ranging
from –5 to +5. [Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus
Spells](#table-1-3-ability-modifiers-and-bonus-spells) shows the
modifier for each score. The modifier is the number you apply to the die
roll when your character tries to do something related to that ability.
You also use the modifier with some numbers that aren't die rolls. A
positive modifier is called a bonus, and a negative modifier is called a
penalty. The table also shows bonus spells, which you'll need to know
about if your character is a spellcaster.

Abilities and Spellcasters
--------------------------

The ability that governs bonus spells depends on what type of
spellcaster your character is: [Intelligence](#intelligence) for
wizards; [Wisdom](#wisdom) for clerics, druids, and rangers; and
[Charisma](#charisma-new) for bards, paladins, and sorcerers. In
addition to having a high [ability score](#ability-scores), a
spellcaster must be of a high enough class level to be able to cast
spells of a given spell level. See the class descriptions in
[Classes](classes.html) for details.

The Abilities
-------------

Each ability partially describes your character and affects some of his
actions.

### Strength ([Str](#strength)) {#strength}

Strength measures muscle and physical power. This ability is important
for those who engage in hand-to-hand (or "melee") combat, such as
fighters, monks, paladins, and some rangers. Strength also sets the
maximum amount of weight your character can carry. A character with a
Strength score of 0 is too weak to move in any way and is unconscious.
Some creatures do not possess a Strength score and have no modifier at
all to Strength-based skills or checks.

You apply your character's Strength modifier to:

-   [Melee attack](combat.html#melee-attacks) rolls.
-   [Damage](combat.html#damage) rolls when using a melee weapon or a
    thrown weapon, including a sling. (Exceptions: Off-hand attacks
    receive only half the character's Strength bonus, while two-handed
    attacks receive 1–1/2 times the Strength bonus. A Strength penalty,
    but not a bonus, applies to attacks made with a bow that is not a
    composite bow.)
-   [Climb](skills/climb.html#climb) and
    [Swim](skills/swim.html#swim) checks.
-   Strength checks (for breaking down doors and the like).

### Dexterity (Dex) {#dexterity}

Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance. This ability is the
most important one for rogues, but it's also useful for characters who
wear light or medium armor or no armor at all. This ability is vital for
characters seeking to excel with ranged weapons, such as the bow or
sling. A character with a Dexterity score of 0 is incapable of moving
and is effectively immobile (but not unconscious).

You apply your character's Dexterity modifier to:

-   [Ranged attack](combat.html#ranged-attacks) rolls, including those
    for attacks made with bows, crossbows, throwing axes, and many
    ranged spell attacks like *scorching ray* or *searing light*.
-   [Armor Class](combat.html#armor-class)
    ([AC](combat.html#armor-class)), provided that the character can
    react to the attack.
-   [Reflex saving throws](combat.html#reflex), for avoiding *fireballs*
    and other attacks that you can escape by moving quickly.
-   [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.html#acrobatics), [Disable
    Device](skills/disableDevice.html#disable-device), [Escape
    Artist](skills/escapeArtist.html#escape-artist),
    [Fly](skills/fly.html#fly), [Ride](skills/ride.html#ride), [Sleight
    of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand.html#sleight-of-hand), and
    [Stealth](skills/stealth.html#stealth) checks.

### Constitution (Con) {#constitution}

Constitution represents your character's health and stamina. A
Constitution bonus increases a character's hit points, so the ability is
important for all classes. Some creatures, such as undead and
constructs, do not have a Constitution score. Their modifier is +0 for
any Constitution-based checks. A character with a Constitution score of
0 is dead.

You apply your character's Constitution modifier to:

-   Each roll of a [Hit Die](#hit-dice) (though a penalty can never drop
    a result below 1—that is, a character always gains at least 1 hit
    point each time he advances in level).
-   [Fortitude saving throws](combat.html#fortitude), for resisting
    poison, disease, and similar threats.

If a character's Constitution score changes enough to alter his or her
Constitution modifier, the character's hit points also increase or
decrease accordingly.

### Intelligence (Int) {#intelligence}

Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. This
ability is important for wizards because it affects their spellcasting
ability in many ways. Creatures of animal-level instinct have
Intelligence scores of 1 or 2. Any creature capable of understanding
speech has a score of at least 3. A character with an Intelligence score
of 0 is comatose. Some creatures do not possess an Intelligence score.
Their modifier is +0 for any Intelligence-based skills or checks.

You apply your character's Intelligence modifier to:

-   The number of bonus
    [languages](skills/linguistics.html#learn-a-language) your character
    knows at the start of the game. These are in addition to any
    starting racial languages and Common. If you have a penalty, you can
    still read and speak your racial languages unless your Intelligence
    is lower than 3.
-   The number of skill points gained each level, though your character
    always gets at least 1 skill point per level.
-   [Appraise](skills/appraise.html#appraise),
    [Craft](skills/craft.html#craft),
    [Knowledge](skills/knowledge.html#knowledge),
    [Linguistics](skills/linguistics.html#linguistics), and
    [Spellcraft](skills/spellcraft.html#spellcraft) checks.

A [wizard](classes/wizard.html#wizard) gains bonus spells based on his
Intelligence score. The minimum Intelligence score needed to cast a
wizard spell is 10 + the spell's level.

### Wisdom (Wis) {#wisdom}

Wisdom describes a character's willpower, common sense, awareness, and
intuition. Wisdom is the most important ability for clerics and druids,
and it is also important for paladins and rangers. If you want your
character to have acute senses, put a high score in Wisdom. Every
creature has a Wisdom score. A character with a Wisdom score of 0 is
incapable of rational thought and is unconscious.

You apply your character's Wisdom modifier to:

-   [Will saving throws](combat.html#will) (for negating the effects of
    *charm person* and other spells).
-   [Heal](skills/heal.html#heal),
    [Perception](skills/perception.html#perception),
    [Profession](skills/profession.html#profession), [Sense
    Motive](skills/senseMotive.html#sense-motive), and
    [Survival](skills/survival.html#survival) checks.

[Clerics](classes/cleric.html#cleric),
[druids](classes/druid.html#druid), and
[rangers](classes/ranger.html#ranger) get bonus spells based on their
Wisdom scores. The minimum Wisdom score needed to cast a cleric, druid,
or ranger spell is 10 + the spell's level.

### Charisma (Cha) {#charisma-new}

Charisma measures a character's personality, personal magnetism, ability
to lead, and appearance. It is the most important ability for paladins,
sorcerers, and bards. It is also important for clerics, since it affects
their ability to channel energy. For undead creatures, Charisma is a
measure of their unnatural "lifeforce." Every creature has a Charisma
score. A character with a Charisma score of 0 is not able to exert
himself in any way and is unconscious.

You apply your character's Charisma modifier to:

-   [Bluff](skills/bluff.html#bluff),
    [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy.html#diplomacy),
    [Disguise](skills/disguise.html#disguise), [Handle
    Animal](skills/handleAnimal.html#handle-animal),
    [Intimidate](skills/intimidate.html#intimidate),
    [Perform](skills/perform.html#perform), and [Use Magic
    Device](skills/useMagicDevice.html#use-magic-device) checks.
-   Checks that represent attempts to influence others.
-   [Channel energy](classes/cleric.html#channel-energy-cleric) DCs for
    [clerics](classes/cleric.html#cleric) and
    [paladins](classes/paladin.html#paladin) attempting to harm
    undead foes.

[Bards](classes/bard.html#bard),
[paladins](classes/paladin.html#paladin), and
[sorcerers](classes/sorcerer.html#sorcerer) gain a number of bonus
spells based on their Charisma scores. The minimum Charisma score needed
to cast a bard, paladin, or sorcerer spell is 10 + the spell's level.
