in line with similar compatible rule systems we will call this class 'Adventurer'.

Adventurers are the heroes and myths of legend and divide their power into three categories.  

* Combat - Prowess with weapons and armor. Gladiator, Swashbuckler and Samurai concepts tend to focus in this
category.

* Magic - The control of mystic energies to produce incredible reality bending effects.  Healer, Wizard and  Witch concepts tend to focus on magic.

* Enhancements - Harnessing the natural potential of a beings body to produce effects that seem to defy the natural order. Monks, fire-eaters, and strong men all tend to focus on this category.

Adventures choose not a single category to focus on but instead declare a priority. All adventures enjoy at least some of the benefits of all three. Each adventurer must declare a primary, secondary and tertiary focus.

> **Example 1: Gertrude**  
> *Brenda is creating a Dwarven adventurer named "Gertrude". Gertrude was inspired
> by tales of forge magic and the mastery of fire and metal so often attributed to
> the dwarven race. To achieve this effect, Brenda decides to have Gertrude focus on
> the following:*
>
> * Primary: Magic
> * Secondary: Combat
> * Tertiary: Enhancements
>
> *Brenda has arranged Gertrude priories such that she might some day be one of the
> most powerful of magic users, hold her own in combat against strong opponents and
> supplement her strengths with a few minor enhancements.*


> **Example 2: Vohdy**  
> *Mark is creating a Human adventurer named "Vohdy". Vohdy was inspired by tales of > shadowy assassins with inhuman abilities. To achieve this effect, Mark decides to > have Vohdy focus on the following:*
>
> * Primary: Combat
> * Secondary: Enhancements
> * Tertiary: Magic
>
> *Mark has arranged Vohdy's priories such that he might some day be one of the most > powerful of weapons masters. Supplement his strength with powerful enhancements
> and use a few minor magic spells.*
