Adventurers are the heroes and myths of legend and divide their power into three categories.  

* Combat - Prowess with weapons and armor. Gladiator, Swashbuckler and Samurai concepts tend to focus in this
category.

* Magic - The control of mystic energies to produce incredible reality bending effects.  Healer, Wizard and  Witch concepts tend to focus on magic.

* Enhancements - Harnessing the natural potential of a beings body to produce effects that seem to defy the natural order. Monks, fire-eaters, and strong men all tend to focus on this category.

Adventures choose not a single category to focus on but instead declare a priority. All adventures enjoy at least some of the benefits of all three. Each adventurer must declare a primary, secondary and tertiary focus.

###### Example 1: Gertrude

Brenda is creating a Dwarven adventurer named "Gertrude". Gertrude was inspired by tales of forge magic and the mastery of fire and metal so often attributed to the dwarven race. To achieve this effect, Brenda decides to have Gertrude focus on the following:

* Primary: Magic
* Secondary: Combat
* Tertiary: Enhancements

Brenda has arranged Gertrude priories such that she might some day be one of the most powerful of magic users. Hold her own in combat against strong opponents and supplement her strengths with a few minor enhancements.

###### Example 2: Vohdy

Mark is creating a Human adventurer named "Vohdy". Vohdy was inspired by tales of shadowy assassins with inhuman abilities. To achieve this effect, Mark decides to have Vohdy focus on the following:

* Primary: Combat
* Secondary: Enhancements
* Tertiary: Magic

Mark has arranged Vohdy's priories such that he might some day be one of the most powerful of weapons masters. Supplement his strength with powerful enhancements and use a few minor magic spells.
